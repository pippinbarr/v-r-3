## Description
*Water! Water! Everywhere! All kinds! Best Water! Decent Water! Realistic Water! Manga Water! Mobile Water! Magic Water! But not a drop to drink!*

*v r 3* is an exhibition of digital water in two galleries. One gallery exhibits Unity's "professional water" according to a systematic demonstration of its paramters (e.g. reflective versus refractive, wave speed, water colour). The other gallery exhibits a set of "third party" waters largely downloaded from (and often purchased from) the Unity asset store (though a couple of waters were lent to the gallery from friends).

## Documentation
* Read the [Process Documentation](../process) for todos, process journal, process images, blog posts, and correspondence
* Read the [Commit History](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-3/commits/master) for detailed, moment-to-moment insights into the development process
* Look at the [Code Repository](https://github.com/pippinbarr/v-r-3) for source code etc.

**Note** that the public repository in this case *excludes the actual water assets* because many of them were paid for and the license doesn't allow for open sourcing in this way. As such it's useless for recreating the game, but is at least here for completeness.
