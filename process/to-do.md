* x (Cannot for the life of me get this to work, even though it's super amazing in demo. Requested refund. The guy is trying to help me. Maybe it's okay if it's super seethrough??? Might need a double-walled plinth custom made for it. Huh.) Realistic Water (kripto289), $35 xxx (Troublesome, might work)

* x (Skipping for now as it's too simlar to Water Flow) Cartoon Water (Stefan M.), $5
* x (will reconsider at end for comparison with Water+ Lite. But actually it only functions as an upgrade to the Lite, so I don't think it will make sense unfortunately...) Water+ (Golden Zebra Software), $7.95
* x (Interesting because it has interactivity, but that's not something I can show) Toon Water, $7.95
* xxx (Doesn't fucking work. Trying to fucking get a fucking refund. Then I got it fucking working in the end? So okay. They helped out.) Water for unity (Magic Water) (HelicalStudio), $10 (also called Magic Water which is funny)

24 waters, 1 free, total of $215.31 (USD presumably?)

## Technical to dos

* ~~Create title screen with water effect and basic fading~~
* ~~Fix weird doorway problems with the player not being always able to walk through~~
* ~~Block the windows so that you can't walk through them~~
* ~~UV Map the plinths~~
* ~~Make a new plinth with a smaller didact (just unextrude since it was a good size before?)~~
* ~~Redo the 3rd party gallery with the new plinth and working waters~~
* ~~Redo the Unity gallery with the new plinth and better didacts~~
* ~~**SO MANY NIGHTMARES ALONG THE WAY** Buy and add more 3rd party step by step...~~
* ~~**I AM SETTLING ON NO** Consider adding a sea (Water4) around the overall landscape?~~
* ~~Add free third-party water and see how hard installation turns out to be~~
* ~~**DON'T RENDER AT SET DISTANCE** Do something about the horrible performance with all 24 waters~~
* ~~Add all Unity waters to scene and check performance~~
* ~~Finally get the shaders and materials cooperating in a clean version of the gallery scene~~
* ~~**SO DONE** Go insane with water shaders and shader keywords enabled and disable~~
* ~~**SEEMS OKAY?** Set up a full room of 24 plinths and check performance etc.~~
* ~~Reset all Water stuff to complete defaults and don't fuck with them so much~~
* ~~Figure out a way to make and use prefabs such that I can make new plinths and install different waters in them~~
* ~~Actually read about how prefabs work~~
* ~~**DONE AND THEN UNDONE SEVERAL TIMES, EVENTUALLY DONE** Work out what the fuck is wrong with the water's reflections in the plinth~~
* ~~Establish a working didact size and legible labelling approach (images in last resort? :( )~~
* ~~Establish a working plinth~~


## Curation to dos

* ~~Label third-party waters~~
* ~~**ENDED UP WITH PARAMETERS LISTED** Label Unity waters~~
* ~~Choose final set of 24 third-party waters~~
* ~~Choose 24 combinations of unity water pro (this is proving really hard.)~~
* ~~**2 x 24, first building is Unity WaterPro, second building is third-party water** Decide on number of waters to be displayed (notably whether it's just Unity water or whether I look at including third party waters)~~
* ~~**GRID OF CUBE PLINTHS** Work on display technologies (all same-height plinths? Different scales?)~~
* ~~**GRID as per v r 2** Work on show layout in the space
* ~~**NO** Consider divider walls or at least a single wall at entry to display a wall text introducing the exhibition (need to be careful about having a text, though, as I don't want to lay out how to think about what the show "is" for the view I don't think should be self-evident/understandable from the mere existence of the show - the main thing is that it communicates "this is an art show and these objects are worth looking at")~~

## Starter to dos

* ~~Figure out some way of labelling work (whether it's a map at entrance or labels/didacts on the display cases)~~
* ~~Play with colliders to get close enough to actually look at the water~~
* ~~Put water in display case~~
* ~~Create test display case~~
* ~~Add gallery name to building~~
* ~~Repaint building (e.g. change material colours)~~
* ~~Add in v r 2 building and landscape (consider whether landscape needs scaling/changing)~~
* ~~Rename project for millionth time, to new-scene-gallery-water~~
* ~~Create Unity scene for Water show~~
